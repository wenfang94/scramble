# scramble
A scramble game is created by using Vue framework.


functionalities:
When the game begins, the player will be presented with a word that has been scrambled. The player will guess by typing into the provided textbox.

If the guess is correct, the player will earn a point, and a new scrambled word will appear. If the guess is incorrect, the player will receive a strike, and the scrambled word will remain.

A pass button will allow the player to skip on a word and receive a new scrambled word. The player will only have a limited number of passes.

Each time a word is guessed correctly or is passed, the word is removed from the game list and will not appear again during that specific game.

The game is over when the player went through all of the words in the game list, OR the player has received the maximum number of strikes. At which time, the player should be presented with an option to play again.
